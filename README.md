# VBAChallenge

In this assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. For the solution, I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and take the following information:
- The ticker symbol.
- Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.

To make it easily readable, I added conditional formatting in the script that highlighted positive change in green and negative change in red.


This was the result:
